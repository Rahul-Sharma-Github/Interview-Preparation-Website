    "option":["(A) 4","(B) 3","(C) 2","(D) 5"],
    "answer":"(B)",
    "solution":"The given number is divisible by 6 so it would be divisible by 2 and 3. As the last digit is 2 whatever be the value of X, it would be divisible by 2.<br>Now, 7+X+2 = 9 + X, must be divisible by 3.<br>∴X = 3 makes the number divisible by 3, so 3 is the required digit."
